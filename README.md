# Book Reads

This is a project made while taking Udacity's React Nanodegree Program.

Book Reads is a book shelf application which allows users to share their current reads. Users can classify the books they have read, are currently reading or want to read in the future. The project is built with React and uses the API server provided by Udacity and a client library that persists information as the user interacts with the application.
